Numerical approximation of slip length over longitudinal SH microgrooves with contact line recession 

This repository contains recipes for numerical solutions of the equations 18 and 21 of Crowdy's POF11 paper, "Frictional slip lengths and blockage coefficients, Crowdy D. POF 23, 091703 (2011)". These equations describe the slip length over a flat surface with SuperHydrophobic longitudinal microgrooves.
